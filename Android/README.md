# Android Examples

The follow example is an Android Studio project that creates a very simple video client.

## Android Studio vs Eclipse

For the Android examples, we use Android studio and gradle.  If you're
using Eclipse ADT then you will need to add the following JAR files to
your lib:

1. [android-async-http](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) (try [MVN repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.loopj.android/android-async-http/1.4.9) for a pre-built JAR file)
1. [Spotify DNS](https://github.com/spotify/dns-java) and its dependencies (try [MVN repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.spotify/dns/3.0.2) for a pre-built JAR file)

See [this issue](https://github.com/pexip/pexkit-sdk/issues/4) for more details
