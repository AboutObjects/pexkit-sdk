# Documentation

The following files will assist you in building up your knowledge
about the SDK and the API's underpinning a Pexip deployment.

The documentation is written from the perspective of an iOS developer
at the moment but the concepts and calls mentioned are identical in
the Android SDK.

The most up to date documentation will always be available through the
built-in documentation provided with the PexKit that is accessible
through your IDE e.g. in Xcode `Alt-clicking` on objects/functions and
`Cmd-clicking` on your pexkit import statement to see class
definitions etc.

The API guide provides a high level call flow mapping calls from the
app, through the conference object and out to the client REST API
provided by the Pexip MCU.

The PexKit overview provides an introduction to some of the concepts
and terminology used by the PexKit.

There is also a small epub that provides more information on the
classes within pexkit.

technical details on the client REST API) please visit
