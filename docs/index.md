## What you'll get here

We'll try and show you how to build a simple cross platform app using
the [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) platform for an iOS and
Android device.  We'll also give a brief introduction to the client
API and cover some basic concepts you'll need when using the Pexip
platform from a client perspective.

## Before we start

We'll be developing our application using Cordova so you'll need a
basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript - you don't need to be
a guru, but this shouldn't be your first rodeo ;-)

Along with these basic web technology skills, you should also have an
understanding of how REST API's work and be comfortable operating on
the command line.

The examples shown here can be developed on any platform but you will
need an Apple Mac if you want to deploy to an iOS device.

We won't be covering how to make your application look amazing or be
[accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/mobile/) to all users - that's up to you.

We also suggest you keep the following links to hand for reference:

 - [Pexip Administration Introduction](https://docs.pexip.com/admin/admin_intro.htm)
 - [Pexip Client REST API Documentation](https://docs.pexip.com/api_client/api_rest.htm)
 - [Pexip Services Guide](https://docs.pexip.com/admin/admin_services.htm)
 - [WebRTC FAQ](https://webrtc.org/faq/)

Oh, it's also super useful if you have a Pexip deployment to work against.

You haven't got one yet?  No worries - sign up for a **[free test drive](https://www.pexip.com/testdrive)** and give it a go.
