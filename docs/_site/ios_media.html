    <section class="main-content">
      <h1 id="ios-media-establishment">iOS Media Establishment</h1>

<p>This section follows on from the <a href="media">high level flow</a> and
discusses how to create a media session using the WebRTC binary.  The
WebRTC implementation is changing rapidly so this document may not
reflect the latest changes -
please <a href="mailto:ian@pexip.com">let us know</a> if this gets out of date.</p>

<h2 id="initializing-the-rtcpeerconnection">Initializing the RTCPeerConnection</h2>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnection</code> object is the main interface to the WebRTC
library and is created using a factory.  First, we must first
initialize the SSL libraries underneath everything by running
<code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCInitializeSSL()</code>. Once we have that done, we can then create a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnectionFactory</code> object and build the component
parts to create our <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnection</code> object.</p>

<p>First we need an <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCBundlePolicy</code> set with <code class="highlighter-rouge">maxCompat</code> so as not to
bundle all media over a single port and we’ll also need to fill in any
ICE server configuration at this point e.g. if your TURN/ICE servers
need any authentication setup (see
<a href="https://docs.pexip.com/admin/about_turn_server.htm">turn server</a> for more
information)
We can then set our media constraints to show if we’re offering video
or audio or both and also set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">DtlsSrtpKeyAgreement</code> to true.
Once we have those, we can pass them into the factory to produce our
RTCPeerConnection object.  For iOS, this could look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/peer_connection.png" alt="peer connection" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="building-media-streams-from-tracks">Building media streams from tracks</h2>

<p>Once we have our <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnectionFactory</code>, we can also use it to
create our media streams and assign our audio and video tracks to
them.  For iOS we’ll be using <code class="highlighter-rouge">AVFoundation</code> sources and using the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">avFoundationVideoSource</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">videoTrack</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">audioTrack</code> methods of
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnectionFactory</code>.  For iOS, this could look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/add_tracks.png" alt="add tracks" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="creating-the-offer-with-ice-candidates">Creating the offer with ICE candidates</h2>

<p>Creating the offer using the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnection</code> object will trigger a
bunch of calls that must be handled by your delegate in particular:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RTCPeerConnection :: didChange newState RTCICEGatheringState</li>
</ul>

<p>As this is what will return the final SDP back up to the application
so we can POST it to the MCU as our offer.  For iOS this could look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/peer_conn_offer.png" alt="peer conn offer" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="mangling-the-sdp-to-set-bandwidths-and-resolutions">Mangling the SDP to set bandwidths and resolutions</h2>

<p>Before we POST the SDP to the MCU we must manipulate our SDP to set
the supported bandwidth and resolutions for the call e.g. make this a
wCIF call at 384kbps.  You could make this decision on behalf of your
user by looking at the connectivity of the device e.g. WiFi or
Cellular or through selection from user input e.g. “High Quality”
might convert to a 2Mbps call @720p.  Bear in mind that this is only
what is offered to the MCU, it might not actually end up being
negotiated and honored.  For more information, the reader is pointed
to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566">RFC4566</a>.  We can mangle the SDP once we
reach the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCICEGatheringState.complete</code> i.e. all the ICE candidates
have been discovered and added to the description and we only really
need to set the <code class="highlighter-rouge">AS</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">TIAS</code> setting for the total session
bandwidth and the RTC constraints for capture device to set the out bound
resolutions (<code class="highlighter-rouge">minWidth</code>).  For iOS, this could look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/sdp_mutation_functions.png" alt="sdp mutation" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="sending-the-sdp-offer">Sending the SDP offer</h2>

<p>Once we have a complete offer with all candidates and we have
manipulated the SDP to what we want we can now POST this to the MCU.  See <a href="https://docs.pexip.com/api_client/api_rest.htm#calls">calls</a> documentation.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-the-sdp-answer">Receiving the SDP answer</h2>

<p>Once the MCU has calculated an answer for for our offer, it will send
back its response and we can then manipulate this further e.g. to
limit the out bound bandwidth from our device and then pass this into
our <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnection</code> objects <code class="highlighter-rouge">remoteDescription</code>. For iOS, this
could look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/remote_sdp.png" alt="remote sdp" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="connecting-streams">Connecting streams</h2>

<p>Once our <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCPeerConnection</code> objects <code class="highlighter-rouge">remoteDescription</code> has been set
and accepted you can now connect up the incoming streams to your views
to display the video and play the sound when the delegate function fires:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RTCPeerConnection :: didAdd stream RTCMediaStream</li>
</ul>

<p>In this event, you can pick out the audio and video streams and attach
them to your <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCEAGLView</code> renderers i.e. the views you have setup to
show video in your app.  For iOS, this could look like:</p>

<p><img src="images/add_stream.png" alt="add stream" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="starting-media-flow">Starting media flow</h2>

<p>Once the offer/answer dance has completed and you have wired up your
streams, you can know trigger the MCU into sending media by sending an
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ack</code> message:
See <a href="https://docs.pexip.com/api_client/api_rest.htm#ack">ack</a>
documentation.  Once this completes, you should start to see and hear
media in your application.  Missing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ack</code> <strong>is a common mistake</strong>
and will mean you don’t see media flowing and can cause headaches
debugging what looks like valid SDP.</p>

<h2 id="switching-streams">Switching streams</h2>

<p>You can switch tracks in the media stream to allow you to do things
like swapping between front and rear cameras.  You can do this using
<code class="highlighter-rouge">useBackCamera</code> on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">RTCAVFoundationVideoSource</code> e.g.:</p>

<p><img src="images/toggle_camera.png" alt="switch stream" style="display:block;margin:auto" /></p>

<h2 id="crossing-the-streams">Crossing the streams</h2>

<p>Never cross the streams, it would be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyaLZHiJJnE">bad</a>.</p>

<h2 id="disconnecting-media-flow">Disconnecting media flow</h2>

<p>Once you have finished you can disconnect the media and drop back down
to an API participant.  See
<a href="https://docs.pexip.com/api_client/api_rest.htm#call_disconnect">disconnect</a> documentation.</p>
