# Pexip SDK - Changes for Developers

We have reprioritised our efforts to focus on development of our
native Pexip clients. In order to do this, we will no longer provide
individual platform-specific SDKs for Android and iOS. This refocus of
development effort will allow us to build a richer and more intuitive
user experience that can be updated more frequently, and allow us to
provide a unified feature set across all platforms, which will benefit
both developers and end users.

We've seen that the vast majority of requests for SDKs are actually
for customers wanting to build a branded application, so as part of
this move we'll be providing a much easier way for customers to
rebrand our existing clients.

For customers still wishing to build bespoke applications, we'll be
moving towards an API-driven approach using our existing REST-based
client API.  This is already well documented
(https://docs.pexip.com/api_client/api_rest.htm), and we'll be adding
to the documentation with more examples and sample code.

Please reach out to your Pexip representative to be kept up to date on
the latest changes and updates.
