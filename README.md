# Pexip SDK - Changes for Developers

We have reprioritised our efforts to focus on development of our
native Pexip clients. In order to do this, we will no longer provide
individual platform-specific SDKs for Android and iOS. This refocus of
development effort will allow us to build a richer and more intuitive
user experience that can be updated more frequently, and allow us to
provide a unified feature set across all platforms, which will benefit
both developers and end users.

We've seen that the vast majority of requests for SDKs are actually
for customers wanting to build a branded application, so as part of
this move we'll be providing a much easier way for customers to
rebrand our existing clients.

# Examples and Documentation

We have a **new site** for all examples and documentation -
see <https://pexip.github.io/pexkit-sdk/>.  It will be updated
regularly.

The definitive Client API reference is always on
[https://docs.pexip.com/](https://docs.pexip.com/)

# Github Issues

We are no longer tracking issues on this site as the support of the
Client API's are covered under the standard Pexip support agreement.

If there are errors with the client API, please reach out to your
support contact at Pexip via apisupport@pexip.com
