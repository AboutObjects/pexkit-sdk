# IOS9 / Xcode 7

Bitcode support is not currently enabled in this release of the SDK.
Please disable bitcode in your "Build Settings" for your target.

# Android Studio vs Eclipse

For the Android examples, we use Android studio and gradle.  If you're
using Eclipse ADT then you will need to add the following JAR files to
your lib:

1. [android-async-http](https://github.com/loopj/android-async-http) (try [MVN repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.loopj.android/android-async-http/1.4.9) for a pre-built JAR file)
1. [Spotify DNS](https://github.com/spotify/dns-java) and its dependencies (try [MVN repository](http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.spotify/dns/3.0.2) for a pre-built JAR file)
