# iOS Example Applications

The examples here show how you can create a very simple iOS
application using the Pexip iOS SDK (PexKit)

The tutorials are provided in .zip form and have the PexKit
pre-installed.  Examples 2 and 3 have a common starting point and if
you wish to follow along with the video tutorials then use the
starting point zip file.

All of these examples are designed to work in Xcode 7 or later with
Swift 2.0 or later using the PexKit from October 2015

## Example 1

This is the simplest possible application that just makes a call out
to a pexip deployment and establishes a video session.

## Example 2

This is a slighty richer application that deals with event handling
for roster lists and also viewing a presentation

## Example 3

This takes example 2 further by presenting a photo back into the
conference.

# Video Tutorials

There are video tutorials that accompany these examples available on
